Curve fitting is the process of constructing a curve, or mathematical function, that has the best fit to a series of data points. possibly subject to constraints. Curve fitting can involve either interpolation, where an exact fit to the data is required, or smoothing, in which a "smooth" function is constructed that approximately fits the data.
